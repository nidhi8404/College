# Writing Java Programs in AWS Cloud9: Sorting Techniques and Finding the Maximum in an Array

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to write Java programs for sorting techniques and finding the maximum element in an array using AWS Cloud9, a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE).

## Prerequisites

1. **AWS Account:** You will need an AWS account to access AWS Cloud9.

2. **AWS Cloud9 Environment:** Set up an AWS Cloud9 environment if you don't already have one. You can follow the [official AWS Cloud9 documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/create-environment.html) for guidance.

## Step 1: Launch AWS Cloud9 Environment

1. Log in to your AWS Management Console.

2. Navigate to the AWS Cloud9 service.

3. Create a new environment or select an existing one.

4. Once your Cloud9 environment is up and running, open the IDE in your web browser.

## Step 2: Write Java Programs

1. In the AWS Cloud9 IDE, you can create and edit Java programs using the built-in code editor.

2. Create a new Java file for sorting techniques (e.g., `SortingTechniques.java`) and another for finding the maximum element in an array (e.g., `FindMaxInArray.java`).

3. Write your Java code for sorting techniques and finding the maximum element in the respective files.

## Step 3: Compile and Run Java Programs

1. Open a terminal in the Cloud9 IDE.

2. Use the `javac` command to compile your Java programs. For example:

    ```shell
    javac SortingTechniques.java
    ```

3. Run your Java programs using the `java` command. For example:

    ```shell
    java SortingTechniques
    ```

4. Follow the same steps to compile and run your program for finding the maximum element in an array.

## Step 4: Test and Debug

1. Test your Java programs with sample data to ensure they work as expected.

2. If you encounter any issues, you can use the debugging features in Cloud9 to identify and fix errors in your code.

## Step 5: Save and Commit Your Code

1. Once you are satisfied with your Java programs, save your code.

2. If you have Git integrated into your Cloud9 environment, you can commit your code to a version control system for safekeeping and collaboration with others.

## Step 6: Deploy Your Java Programs (Optional)

1. If you want to deploy your Java programs to AWS services or other cloud platforms, you can use AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS Lambda, or other AWS services depending on your application's requirements.

2. Follow the relevant AWS documentation to deploy your Java applications.

## Step 7: Cleanup (If Needed)

If you no longer need your AWS Cloud9 environment, remember to clean up your resources to avoid ongoing charges.

That's it! You've successfully written and executed Java programs for sorting techniques and finding the maximum element in an array using AWS Cloud9. Customize your Java code as needed and explore AWS services for deploying and running your Java applications in the cloud.
