## Permanent and Temporary S3 Buckets in AWS

In AWS, S3 buckets can be categorized into two types:

1. **Permanent Bucket:** By default, S3 buckets are permanent. Data stored in these buckets remains until explicitly deleted. They are ideal for long-term data storage, backups, and content distribution.

2. **Temporary Bucket:** You can configure S3 buckets for short-term purposes. For tasks like temporary data processing, set up retention or lifecycle policies to automatically delete objects after a specific period, making the bucket temporary.
